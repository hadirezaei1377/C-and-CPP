main is the first thing for complier!

declrare variables:
int i ;
float y,f,z ;

int i = 0 ;

const :
1-using #define
like : #define A 1
       #define H Hadi

they dont need ; because its not command in c++ , its pre-processing

2-using const
like : const int i=0;

operators in c++:
x = x + y : += 
x = x - y : -=
x = x*y   : *=
x = x/y   : /=
x = x % y : %=


recieve data by cin, print output by cout, both of them related to iostream package
cin and cout are using for recieving data from a window on monitor and print data to a window on monitor, its console and we use fstream package
